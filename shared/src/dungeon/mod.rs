//! Procedural nethack-style dungeon generation, shared verbatim between
//! the native server and the WASM web client. Layouts are fully
//! deterministic from a seed (derived from the entrance id), so neither
//! side ever sends geometry over the wire — both regenerate the same
//! rooms, corridors and stair shafts and only entity state is networked.
//!
//! Determinism rules (enforced by the golden-hash test in `tests`):
//! - RNG is `ChaCha8Rng` only. `SmallRng` is a different algorithm on
//!   wasm32 vs 64-bit native and must never be used here.
//! - No `HashMap`/`HashSet` iteration, no platform-dependent float math
//!   in anything that influences the layout.
//!
//! Coordinate model: each floor is a `GRID`×`GRID` field of 1m cells
//! centered on the dungeon entrance. Depth `d` (1-based) lives at world
//! `y = entrance.y - d * DUNGEON_FLOOR_HEIGHT` and registers in the
//! passability cache as floor index `passability_floor_for_depth(d)`.
//! The offset keeps dungeon floors clear of housing floor levels 0-3 —
//! `is_cardinal_move_blocked` matches by floor index alone, so reusing
//! 0..3 would make dungeon walls block players walking on the surface
//! above the dungeon footprint.
//!
//! Floors connect through 2×`SHAFT_LEN` stair shafts that occupy the
//! same cells on both adjacent floors; the entry landing belongs to the
//! shallower floor, the exit landing to the deeper one, and A* walks
//! them via the existing housing stairwell intermediate-key machinery.
