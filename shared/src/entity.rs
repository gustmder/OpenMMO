/// with, above all monster ids: `Monster::is_controllable_by` is an
/// authorization gate, and before this the two were the same type there.

/// follow from that, and this is the one place they are stated:
///
/// 1. Ids are minted from a counter starting at 1 (the server's
///    `next_player_id`), so they stay far below 2^53 and survive the JS number
///    boundary exactly. `0` is therefore free to mean "no player".
/// 2. Never use this as a map key in a type that crosses `wasm_api::to_js`.
///    `serialize_maps_as_objects` rejects non-string keys outright and the
///    client swallows the resulting error, so the whole frame silently
///    disappears. `ServerMessage::GameState` carries a `Vec<Player>` for this
///    reason.
