//! Phase 7: high-resolution tile baking.
//!
//! Consumes the low-resolution `GlobalMap` (elevation + land mask), the
//! flow/river map from Phase 4, and the road network from Phase 6, and
//! produces per-tile binary artifacts that match the runtime
//! `terrain::TerrainIO` layout:
//!
//! * 65×65 uint16 heightmap (`defaults::HEIGHTMAP_SIZE = 8,450` bytes)
//! * 64×64×4 byte V2 splatmap (`defaults::SPLATMAP_SIZE = 16,384` bytes)
//!
//! The global map lives at `meters_per_cell` m/cell (typically 8). Tile
//! vertices are 1 m apart, so each vertex sample is a bilinear interpolation
//! of 2×2 global cells plus a high-frequency detail noise term. Rivers and
//! roads are handled as world-space polylines (Chaikin-smoothed) and queried
//! by point-to-segment distance during bake. The splat layer uses a fixed
//! five-slot region palette; primary/secondary indices and the `blend` byte
//! are chosen per-cell by a priority ladder (road > river > sea > cliff >
//! alpine > slope > coast > plain). Cliff wins over alpine so a vertical
//! marble face on a snowy peak still reads as bare rock.
