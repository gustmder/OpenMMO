//! Phase 2: elevation layering.
//!
//! Converts the binary land mask from Phase 1 into a meter-scale heightmap:
//!   - **base gradient**: land cells rise smoothly with distance from the
//!     coast, saturating at `base_elevation_m` around 40% inland.
//!   - **mountain/plain mask**: a low-frequency fBm noise decides whether a
//!     region is mountainous or flat. Top `mountain_ratio` quantile among
//!     land cells = mountain; rest = plain.
//!   - **detail noise**: high-frequency fBm (octave-rich) provides local
//!     peaks/valleys on top of the base. Amplitude is `mountain_amplitude_m`
//!     in mountains and `plain_amplitude_m` on plains.
//!   - **Y-border mountain wall**: because the Y axis doesn't wrap, land
//!     within `y_border_wall_cells` of the north or south border is lifted
//!     toward `y_border_wall_height_m` to form an impassable range.
//!   - Sea cells always sit at 0 m.
