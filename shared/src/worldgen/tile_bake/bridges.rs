//! Bridge placement at road↔river crossings.
//!
//! Run after `roads::snap_crossings_to_grid`: every interior road cell that
//! coincides with a river cell becomes one bridge. Visible water width at
//! the crossing is `baked_width + 2 × segment_carve_taper_at(...)` — the
//! same envelope `river_field::compute_pixel` uses to collapse surface→bed,
//! so it matches the depth-fade contour the player sees. That width is
//! compared against `BRIDGE_WIDE_RIBBON_M` to pick the wide
//! (`bridge_wood_long`) vs the narrow (`stone_bridge`) model.
//!
//! Bridge Y sits at the midpoint of the surface the deck ends meet:
//! heights are sampled perpendicular to the river tangent at
//! `model.deck_min_z` and `model.deck_max_z`, then run through
//! `settlement_flatten::flatten_height_at` so a deck end inside a town
//! pad reads the flattened pad surface instead of the natural hill. The
//! river carve stays excluded — the carve runs after the pad in the per-
//! tile bake and would pull the sample below the level the bridge
//! visually meets. Sampling at the deck-end distance (rather than further
//! out past the carve) keeps the flattened deck rect aligned with the
//! surrounding terrain. Rotation comes from the road tangent (perpendicular
//! to the river tangent) — converted to a three.js Y-rotation that aligns
//! the deck's local +Z with the road direction.
//!
//! Per-tile heightmap flatten replicates the editor's
//! `flattenRotatedRect` (see
//! `client/src/lib/managers/terrain-height-brushes.ts`): inside the rotated
//! deck rect `targetY = placement.y + minLocalY + buryDepth`; outside, a
//! `BRIDGE_FLATTEN_BLEND_M` smoothstep blend back to the natural height.
