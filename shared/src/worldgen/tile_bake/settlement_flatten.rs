//! Per-tile heightmap flatten around each settlement.
//!
//! Every settlement gets a circular flat pad on the heightmap so houses sit
//! on level ground regardless of the underlying hills/slope. Splatmap is
//! untouched (roads, sand, dirt etc. paint through normally) — this is a
//! geometry-only pass run after `sample_tile_heights`.
//!
//! Target Y is the un-carved natural sample at the settlement center
//! (`sample_natural_height_single`), so a pad centered near a river never
//! inherits the carved bed and sinks the village underwater.
