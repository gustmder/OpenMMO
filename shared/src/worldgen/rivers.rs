//! Phase 4: flow accumulation and river extraction.
//!
//! On a heightmap, water flows from high elevation toward low. Each land
//! cell has a single "downstream" neighbor (the 8-connected neighbor with
//! the steepest descent). Flow accumulation counts, for every cell, how
//! many upstream cells drain into it — i.e. how much rain reaches that
//! point along the gradient field.
//!
//! Cells whose accumulation exceeds a threshold are rivers. Tracing each
//! such cell's downstream chain to the sea yields river polylines, which
//! subsequent phases (splatmap, vegetation) use to paint riverbeds and
//! tint vegetation density.
