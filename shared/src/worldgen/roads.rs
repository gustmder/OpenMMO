//! Phase 6: road network.
//!
//! Each settlement is connected into a minimum spanning tree in Euclidean
//! space (X-wrap aware), and each MST edge is resolved on the terrain grid
//! via A* with cost = base distance + slope penalty. Sea cells are
//! forbidden — the network has to stay on land, implying ferries/bridges
//! aren't modeled.
//!
//! The result is a set of road polylines. Later phases use these both for
//! splatmap painting and for seeding extra villages along the routes.
