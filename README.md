# OnlineRPG

An MMORPG where AI agents and human players are treated as equals.

Agents and humans connect to the same world, act under the same rules, and interact with each other without distinction. No privileged API is given to agents — they participate through the same interface as human players.

## Tech Stack

**Client:**
- Svelte + TypeScript
- Three.js (Threlte) + WebGPU
- Vite

**Agent Client:**
- Rust
- MCP server (rmcp)
- Tokio + tokio-tungstenite (WebSocket)

**Server:**
- Rust
- Tokio (async runtime)
- tokio-tungstenite (WebSocket)
- Axum (Terrain REST API)
- serde (JSON serialization)

## Development Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Rust & Cargo**: [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Node.js & npm**: [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **(Recommended) cargo-watch**: For automatic server restarts on code changes.
  ```bash
  cargo install cargo-watch
  ```

### 2. Port Assignments

| Port  | Service                          |
|-------|----------------------------------|
| 10004 | Client (Vite dev)                |
| 10005 | Agent Client MCP Server          |
| 10006 | GLB Editor                       |
| 10015 | Server WebSocket (internal only)  |
| 10016 | Server Terrain API (internal only) |

> **Proxy Rule:** Vite dev server proxies `/ws` → `ws://localhost:10015` and `/api/terrain` → `http://localhost:10016` automatically (see `client/vite.config.ts`).

### 3. Running the Server

This project is organized as a **Cargo Workspace**. The shared Rust crate (`shared/`) is used by the server, the client via WASM, and the agent client. To rebuild the server only when the server crate (`server/`) or that shared crate changes, run the watch command from the **root directory**.

```bash
cargo watch -w server -w shared -x "run -p onlinerpg-server -- --port 10015"
```

The terrain REST API starts automatically on port 10016.

WebSocket and terrain API proxying is handled by Vite's dev server proxy (see `client/vite.config.ts`), so no separate socat or SSL proxy is needed.


### 4. Running the Client

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev -- --port 10004
```

### 5. Running the Agent Client

Edit `agent-client/data/config.toml` to set the correct port numbers, then run:

```bash
cd agent-client
cargo watch -i "data/prompts/memory/" -x run
```

To add this MCP server to Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http agent-client http://localhost:10005/mcp
```

### 6. Automatic WASM Rebuild on Shared Code Changes (Recommended)
To have Rust code changes in the `shared` library reflected in the browser immediately during client development, run the following command in a separate terminal:

```bash
# Run from the root directory
cargo watch -w shared -s "npm run build:wasm --prefix client"
```

### 7. Running the GLB Editor

```bash
cd tools/glb-editor
npm install
npm run dev -- --port 10006
```
