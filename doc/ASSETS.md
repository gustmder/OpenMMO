# Blender

- Use version 5.1.0
- blender-scripts
  - fix_mixamo_transforms.py
  
    mixamo에서 import한 armature와 mesh가 각각 scale이 0.01, 100.0으로 되어 있는 것을 1.0, 1.0으로 맞춰준다.
  
  - add_action_to_nla.py
    
    mixamo에서 import한 메쉬없는 애니메이션을 최초의 armature에 붙여준다

## Import tips

- .glb를 import 할 때 거대한 구가 나타나는 경우 bone shape scale을 0.01로 하면 거대한 구체가 나타나는 것을 방지할 수 있다.

## Export tips

- Backface Culling: Material Properties → Settings → Backface Culling 켜기(뒷면 제거).
- Shader Editor 활성화
  - Alpha가 의도치 않게 들어가 있는지: Base Color 텍스처에 알파가 섞여 Alpha에 연결돼 있지 않은지 확인.
- .glb 내보내기 시 권장 옵션(Blender glTF 2.0 Exporter)
  - Apply Modifiers: 켜기
  - (노멀맵 쓴다면) Tangents: 켜기

## Splat Map용 텍스처 GLB 내보내기

- Plane의 크기는 상관없다. 코드에서 geometry는 무시하고 material의 텍스처만 추출한다.
  - `splatLayerLoader.ts`가 GLB를 로드한 뒤 첫 번째 `MeshStandardMaterial`에서 `map`, `normalMap`, `roughnessMap`, `metalnessMap`, `aoMap`만 꺼내 쓴다.
  - 터레인 geometry는 별도로 `PlaneGeometry(64, 64)`를 생성한다.
- 중요한 것은 Blender에서 material에 올바른 텍스처(albedo, normal, roughness 등)가 할당되어 있는지이다.

  A sweeping medieval fantasy RPG overworld theme inspired by "Stones" from the Ultima series.

The music swells with noble brass and full orchestral strings as the adventurer crosses rugged mountain ranges in search of treasure. The mood is hopeful and grand — a sense of the heart expanding, chest opening wide with wonder and possibility. Melodic, singable theme that lingers in memory. Warm, nostalgic, yet epic. No vocals.
